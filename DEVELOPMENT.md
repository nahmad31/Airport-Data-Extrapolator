## Week 1
During week 1, we started implementing the Graph class. We decided to use an adjaceny list to improve performance, 
except with a HashMap for the edges as well. This was done to improve lookup time, which is essential when dealing with large datasets.
We have not run any tests on the Graph implementation yet and plan to have it finished and tested by the end of next week. We also started
working on loading in the data files. While the implementation is functional, it currently reads only 0.8% of the data as valid. This should
be fully functional by the end of next week.

## Week 2
During week 2, we finished implementing existing functions and started testing. There are still some small bugs to be fixed in loadFile (not converting monthly to weekly flights) and potentially in the graph implementation. Next week, we will test and debug our functions further and write the shortest path algorithm.

## Week 3
During week 3, we finished implementing all the code for the final project. The bugs and memory leaks from last week have been fixed, and we have written the Markov and shortest path implementations, as well as the main function and several more tests. Next week, we hope to make the video and write RESULTS.md.
